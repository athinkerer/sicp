SICP Solutions
==============
This is my attempt at solving exercies in the text [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][1].

Disclaimer
==========
This is not a canonical source of solutions to exercises in [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][1]. The purpose of this repository is for me to be able to work on the exercises both from my home and work computer. For a community effort at documenting the solutions to exercises in this book, take a look at [SchemeWiki SICP solutions](http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions).
